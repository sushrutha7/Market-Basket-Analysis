# Market-Basket-Analysis

  Most of the population of India is dependent on agriculture. Agro-based industry has a significant role in the economy in fostering the rural development in the country. Agro-industries provide a primary means of converting raw agricultural materials into value added products, while generating income and employment and contributing to overall economic development. They employ a range of technologies, ranging from very simple technologies such as drying of a single product, to more complex technologies such as the irradiation of formulated products.
  Market Basket Analysis (MBA) promises to be the next step in the progression of retail merchandising and promotion. The practice identifies links involving items or connecting categories of items that regulars have a propensity to procure jointly (complements) or between items customers rarely purchase together
The objective of the project is to identify the associated products and the ranking of associations using market basket analysis.
